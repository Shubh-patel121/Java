   # Variables:- are the temporary storage or the containers which are used to store the data.
   In java it consist of three things-
   1. data type i.e which type of data value it is going to store;
   2. variable name
   3. value of the variable;

 -> Zero or more modifiers :-  (specify permission) 
 -> Variables are also known as fields of a class or properties of a class. 
 -> Variable name starts with lower case letter and every inner word starts with upper case letter.
 -> This convention is also known as mixed case convention.

   Example : public final int x=100;

   IMP:- Based on the data type, variable will take default value like in case of Boolean it is false;
   ## There are three types of variables in java
      1. Local variables.
      2. Instance variables.
      3. Static variables.
